# PortfolioPage

## Description

This is a portfolio site for Christopher Josephs meant to showcase pieces of his work for future employers to marvel at! On this site you will see an "About Me" section, a section with hyperlinks to the websites of my projects, back and front end proficiences, a link to download my resume, and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. This portfolio page was made using React.

## Features

My portfolio contains three different sections. The "About Me" section contains information about Christopher Josephs. The "Works" section containes brief descriptions and images of my works, when you click on the pictures you will be redirected to those respective websites. The "Contact" section allows you to send a message to him with your name and email address. React and Fontawesome were utilized in the making of this page. I still have much to learn as a junior developer and this is just the start. You will get to see my growth as a developer as you see this page continue to develop.
